## baseline benchmarks for comparison

- DirectBuffer - Use go to write the HTML by hand to the buffer with basic escaping

## transpiling to Go Template

- [Damsel](https://github.com/dskinner/damsel) I won't benchmark transpiling
  engines, because transpilation should just happen once at startup. If you
  cache the transpilation result, which is recommended, you would have the same
  performance numbers as html/template for rendering.

## Why?

Just for fun. Go Templates work nice out of the box and should be used for
rendering from a security point of view. If you care about performance you
should cache the rendered output.

Sometimes there are templates that cannot be reasonably cached. Then you might
need a really fast template engine with code generation.

## How to run the benchmarks

```
./bench.sh -c go
```

## Security

All packages assume that template authors are trusted. If you allow custom
templates you have to sanitize your user input e.g.
[bluemonday](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday). Generally speaking I
would suggest to sanitize every input not just HTML-input.
